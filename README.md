# 2_Professional_Portfolio

## Description

This is my work-in-progress portfolio.  Placeholder links are placed where applicable to be later filled in.  A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.  I'm hoping to use what I learn in this class to create a true professional portfolio for my future career.

## Coding Language
HTML & CSS.  More to come.

## Notes
Placeholder links are set for all social and project links.

Media queries are set for screen 425px, 768px, and larger.

Font size automatically adjust with smaller screen size to fit.
